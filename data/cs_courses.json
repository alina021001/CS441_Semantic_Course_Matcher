To this end, there has been growing interest from researchers and practitioners to develop and deploy ML models and algorithms that are not only accurate, but also fair, interpretable, robust and privacy-preserving. This broad area of research is commonly referred to as trustworthy ML. <br/> This course will cover topics within the broad area of trustworthy ML, including algorithmic fairness, model interpretability, model robustness to distributional shift, adversarial robustness, and differential privacy. Prerequisites include probability and statistics, linear algebra and calculus.

Description: This course explores the powerful intersection of theory and practice in algorithmic problem-solving, teaching students to apply advanced computational tools like LP solvers, SAT/SMT solvers, metaheuristics, and other modern theoretical tools to real-world engineering, optimization, and decision-making challenges. We explain the theory behind these tools to build intuition, but the emphasis is on application: modeling, using solvers effectively, and engineering robust, efficient solutions. Students will gain hands-on experience working on problems in logistics, verification, scheduling, auctions, online algorithms, and LLMs. By the end of the course, students will not only understand the basic underlying theoretical principles, but more importantly, be equipped to integrate these powerful tools into complex, real-world systems. Prerequisites: CS374 or equivalent coursework with a solid foundation in algorithms. Mathematical maturity. Proficient in programming, with strong experience in Python and/or at least one compiled language such as C, C++, Java, or Rust.

As a consequence, new data management requirements have emerged with multiple solutions to address them. This course will look at the principles behind data management in the cloud as well as discuss actual cloud data management systems that are currently in use or being developed. The topics covered in the course range from novel data processing paradigms (MapReduce, Scope, DryadLINQ), to commercial cloud data management platforms (Google BigTable, Microsoft Azure, Amazon S3 and Dynamo, Yahoo PNUTS) and open-source NoSQL databases (Cassandra, MongoDB, Neo4J). The world of cloud data management is currently very diverse and heterogeneous. Therefore, our course will also report on efforts to classify, compare and benchmark the various approaches and systems. Students in this course will gain broad knowledge about the current state of the art in cloud data management and, through a course project, practical experience with a specific system.

There is, however, an orders of magnitude gap in the performance, power, and quality of experience of systems we can build today and those we desire.

Recent advances in AI culminate a shift in science and engineering away from strong reliance on algorithmic and symbolic knowledge towards new data-driven approaches. The course discusses how the emerging intelligent data-centric world impacts research on IoT and embedded computing. It organizes these effects around the types of bottlenecks that arise. At training time, in intelligent IoT applications, the bottlenecks are generally data related. IoT applications often exploit scarce data modalities (such as heterogeneous sensor data), unlike those commonly addressed in mainstream AI, necessitating solutions for efficient learning from scarce sensor data. At inference time, the bottlenecks are resource-related, calling for smaller models (such as small language models and application-specific foundation models) and improved resource economy (thanks to a variety of optimization techniques including quantization, caching, early exit networks, and mixture-of-expert scheduling policies). Furthermore, the convergence of AI around specific model architectures introduces additional model-related challenges in IoT contexts. The class discusses the research directions that arise in the data-centric world of intelligent IoT, covering data-, resource-, and model-related challenges, and overviews recent solutions emerging in this important domain.

At the same time, effective AI models such as large language models may also provide insights useful for understanding biological intelligence. This course will explore a broad range of topics in AI, as well as biological principles of intelligence and their implementation in AI. We will review current state-of-the-art AI models, with particular focus on biological plausibility. Course topics may include but are not limited to: biological and artificial memory systems, generative AI models, reinforcement learning algorithms, and evolution of nervous systems and behavioral complexity. There will be weekly discussions and student presentations of recent papers, aiming to explore the potential advantages, complexities, and short-comings of the AI models presented, and how they relate back to biological, psychological, and evolutionary principles.",

Description: This is a course on applied algorithms, focusing on the use of discrete mathematics, graph theory, probability theory, statistics, machine learning, and simulations, to design and analyze algorithms for community detection, community search, and community extraction in large graphs (e.g., social networks, biological networks, and citation graphs) with millions of nodes, with the goal of making important breakthroughs in either theory or development of improved scalable methods. We will examine these questions from both a theoretical perspective (e.g., computational complexity and design of algorithms for hard optimization problems, resolution limit) as well as from a data-driven perspective. Of particular interest in this course are how well existing methods actually perform on large real-world and synthetic datasets in terms of cluster quality, which includes density, separability, and well-connectedness (e.g., the size of the minimum edge cut). Clustering accuracy will also be explored using synthetic networks, and so limitations of current simulators are also of interest. The course will involve substantial literature review and critique, hands-on assignments using existing codes on large networks, and a final course project that is designed by the student, and which should be presented in a final paper that is suitable for submission to a conference such as KDD, Neurips, or Complex Networks and their Applications. This course is designed for PhD students in Computer Science with an interest in algorithm design and implementation (including parallel and HPC implementations), but students from closely related programs (e.g., ECE, ISE, Mathematics, and Statistics) with strong theoretical backgrounds are welcome.

Description: This course introduces core concepts and modern methods in geospatial artificial intelligence, focusing on spatial and spatiotemporal models based on data from remote sensing (RS), Earth observation (EO), and smart city systems. Geospatial data is inherently multi-modal—combining imagery, time series, maps, and sensor streams—and the course explores how to model such complexity using both classical and modern AI tools. We begin with foundational approaches including kriging, Gaussian processes, and spatiotemporal geostatistics. The course then moves into advanced AI-driven models, including self-supervised learning, geospatial foundation models, and architectures adapted from vision and language domains to Earth data. Applications include weather forecasting, crop type and yield prediction, resource management, and urban analytics. A hands-on component using modern geospatial ML frameworks (e.g., TorchGeo) will enable students to engage directly with real-world RS/EO data and models.

One reason for this gap is the focus on “sick care,” which reactively treats illness with costly interventions that often fail to improve outcomes. A better approach is proactive care that emphasizes prevention and healthy living. Behavioral health—which includes lifestyle and mental, emotional, and social well-being—is central to this shift. In this course, we will develop practical AI solutions to monitor and improve behavioral health. This course makes extensive use of modern mobile and wearable sensing technologies. The curriculum has two parts. In the first part, we focus on continuous monitoring of well-being (e.g., mental health) and lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity, nutrition, sleep, stress, and substance use. Continuous monitoring lays the foundation for identifying health risks early, before problems occur. The second part covers interventions to improve health outcomes. We will explore early risk prediction and the design of personalized, just-in-time interventions. Each week, the instructor will introduce a specific topic (e.g., sleep), and students will present and discuss related research papers. For the final assignment, students may choose between a project or a paper that applies course concepts in an innovative way. This course takes a human-centered AI approach, as the technologies must seamlessly integrate into free-living settings for effective monitoring and intervention.",

In other words, the performance of programs requiring HPC (resource intensive codes) need to be portable across the main existing architectures and across the machines that will be developed in time. In order not to have to rewrite entire applications to port them across systems we raise the level of abstraction at which programs are written and leave the 'details\" of mapping the application onto the architecture to the vendors themselves. One way to achieve portable performance of applications and ease of programming effort is to use a hierarchical system of generic and domain specific libraries. In this course we will present several high level libraries and languages that can be built on top of the existing software development infrastructure, i.e. do not require new compilers, debuggers, etc. performance Libraries have to implement parallel algorithms and programs without requiring the user to deal with the complexities of parallel program execution on a parallel architecture. In this course we first present the state of the art in parallel programming models. Then we will present the latest approaches to parallel library design and how they alleviate the performance portability and ease of use problems. We will cover generic libraries such as TBB, STAPL, Cilk++ and then spend some time on infrastructures for machine learning applications such as Tensorflow. Grading will be based on paper presentations and a final class project requiring parallel programming and performance evaluation on a a parallel computer.",
